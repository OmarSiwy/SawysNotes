          # Crawl all pages using wget (recursive, convert links for static)
          # We need to crawl local server which is running at root,
          # but the generated HTML will now have /SawysNotes/ prefix on links.
          # Wget needs to follow them. Actually, wget is crawling localhost:3000.
          # The server returns HTML with /SawysNotes/ links.
          # Wget might fail to follow /SawysNotes/ links if they don't map to localhost:3000/SawysNotes
          # 
          # WAIT: If the server generates links like "/SawysNotes/analog", clicking them on localhost:3000
          # leads to localhost:3000/SawysNotes/analog.
          # But our axum router is not mounted at /SawysNotes.
          #
          # FIX: We must update the server to ALSO respect SITE_URL in routing?
          # OR: we just strip the prefix in the router?
          #
          # Simpler approach:
          # If we generate static site for GitHub pages, we can just let axum run at root,
          # but we need to trick wget or the router.
          #
          # Actually, if we set SITE_URL=/SawysNotes, the links become /SawysNotes/foo.
          # Wget sees <a href="/SawysNotes/foo">. It requests http://127.0.0.1:3000/SawysNotes/foo.
          # Our router expects /foo.
          #
          # So we ALSO need to wrap the router in a Nest or just handle the strip prefix.
          
          # Actually, we should just crawl the site URL
