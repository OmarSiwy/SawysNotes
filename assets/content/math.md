# Math

Welcome to the Math section! This covers mathematical concepts, proofs, and applications relevant to engineering and computer science.

## Coming Soon

This section is under development. Topics will include:

Test Math: $E = mc^2$ and display math:
$$ \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} $$
